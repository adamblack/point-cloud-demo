# Point cloud visualizer demo

Showcase project about point clouds, depth maps, image morphing and Three.js. You can find more information about the project's background in my [blog post](https://medium.com/@adamias/point-clouds-visualization-with-three-js-5ef2a5e24587).

Demo also [contains examples](https://adamblack.github.io/point-cloud-demo/dist/client/vector.html) of how to compute / select the best path within the vector field. More detailed description is in [another blog post](https://medium.com/@adamias/vector-fields-and-fuel-consumption-wrapped-in-3d-475a8a9fd57c).
